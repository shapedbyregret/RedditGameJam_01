# Collapse

**Description**

A flash game entrant for Reddit Game Jam 1. It is a simple arena shmup
where you have to prevent asteroids and debris from falling into
the black hole. No sounds =/

** Controls **

Move with ASDW

Aim with the mouse


**Postmortem**

I like the concept of the game but feel it has not reached its potential. 
The gameplay is sorely lacking and a bit boring. There is little strategy
to be had from having ghosts of the player come back and fight alongside
the current character. Still, I am glad I implemented it. It was easier
than I initially thought and will definitely be using it in future games.
One feature I wish I had time to add is the black hole collapsing (hence
the game's name 'Collapse') after reaching a certain size. Initially
planned for all hell to break lose once too many enemies and debris had
been sucked in.
